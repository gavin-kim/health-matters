<strong>TODO LIST:</strong>

1. The name of Title
2. Same footer and header from the main page should show on all pages.
3. Make hospital button with some icon in main.html. - Change the link to the button in hospital-details.html.
6. Add image icons to minerial links, and images to mineral pages. Not sure if need to do both, check with requirements.(img link in xml)
7. Both xml files look the same in context, use teacher one. Maybe delete other if not being used. 
8. Google map to be focused in correct area
